GNU Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.

To make licensing easier, license headers in the source files will be
a single line reference to Unique License Identifiers as defined by
the Linux Foundation's SPDX project [1].  For example,
in a source file the full "GPL v2.0 or later" header text will be
replaced by a single line:

	SPDX-License-Identifier:	GPL-2.0+

the license terms of all files in the source tree should be defined
by such License Identifiers; in no case a file can contain more than
one such License Identifier list.

If a "SPDX-License-Identifier:" line references more than one Unique
License Identifier, then this means that the respective file can be
used under the terms of either of these licenses, i. e. with

	SPDX-License-Identifier:	GPL-2.0+	LGPL-2.1+

you can chose between GPL-2.0+ and LGPL-2.1+ licensing.

We use the SPDX Unique License Identifiers here; these are available
at [2].
