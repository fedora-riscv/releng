Code testing helps shake out issues before they get into the wider world.

A very basic vagrant file is provided to allow contributors to work on issues
without installing all of the python3 libaries to their local workstation.

Tests may be added via the tests directory in the format:
  tests/<class|script>_test.py

'make test' - runs current tests
'make pylint' - runs the python3 linter
'make pep8' - runs pep8 checks against the code
'make install-requires' - installs required python libraries
'make check' - runs pylint and pep8 against all code
'make flake8' - runs fake8 test against scripts/push-two-week-atomic.py

The testing framework is written for Python3 to help fix issues during the
conversion to Python3 scheduled for Fedora 27.
