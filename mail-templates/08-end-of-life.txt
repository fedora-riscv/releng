Hello all,

Fedora Linux fN will go end of life for updates and support on
YYYY-MM-DD.
No more updates of any kind, including security updates or security
announcements, will be available for Fedora Linux fN after the said
date. All the updates of Fedora Linux fN being pushed to stable will be
stopped as well.

Fedora Linux fN+1 will continue to receive updates until approximately
one month after the release of Fedora Linux fN+2. The maintenance
schedule of Fedora Linux releases is documented on the Fedora Project
wiki [1]. The Fedora Project wiki also contains instructions[2] on how
to upgrade from a previous release of Fedora Linux to a version
receiving updates.

Regards,
Fedora Release Engineering
