Hi all,

Today's an important day on the Fedora N schedule[1], with several
significant cut-offs. First of all, today is the Bodhi updates-testing
activation point [2]. That means that from now all Fedora N packages must
be submitted to updates-testing and pass the relevant
requirements[3] before they will be marked as 'stable' and moved to
the fedora repository.

Today is also the Beta freeze[4]. This means that only packages which
fix accepted blocker or freeze exception bugs[5][6] will be marked as
'stable' and included in the Beta composes. Other builds will remain
in updates-testing until the Beta release is approved, at which point
the Beta freeze is lifted and packages can move to 'stable' as usual
until the Final freeze.

Today is also the Software String freeze[7], which means that strings
marked for translation in Fedora-translated projects should not now be
changed for Fedora N.

Finally, today is the 'completion deadline' Change Checkpoint[8],
meaning that Fedora N Changes must now be 'feature complete or close
enough to completion that a majority of its functionality can be
tested'. All tracking bugs should be on ON_QA state or later to
reflect this.
