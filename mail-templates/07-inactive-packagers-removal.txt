Hi all,

Today, YYYY-MM-DD, we will be removing inactive packagers
from the packager group.

This is in accordance with the FESCo policy on inactive packagers:
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Policy_for_inactive_packagers/

If the removed user is 'main admin' for a package, this package
will be orphaned. If there are co-maintainers for the package,
one of them should take the role of 'main admin',
by clicking "âœ‹ Take" on
`https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/<package>`".

Otherwise any packager may take the package while it's orphaned.
After 6 weeks, the package will be retired.
After another 8 weeks, a new review is needed to unretire it.
see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Policy_for_orphan_and_retired_packages/
for more details.

Packages that have been orphaned are:
