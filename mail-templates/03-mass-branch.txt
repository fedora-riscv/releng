Hi All,

Fedora Linux fN has now been branched, please be sure to do a
'git fetch -v' to pick up the new branch. As an additional reminder,
rawhide/fN has been completely isolated from previous releases, which
means that anything you do for fN you also have to do in the rawhide
branch and do a build there. There will be a Fedora Linux fN compose and
it will appear in [1] once complete.

Bodhi is currently enabled in the fN branch like it is for rawhide, with
automatic update creation. At the hit Beta change freeze point in the
Fedora Linux fN schedule [2] updates-testing will be enabled and manual
bodhi updates will be required as in all stable releases.

Two things to remember:

1. The modules will be built for a new platform:fN+1
2. fN/branched release is frozen right now until we get a successful
   compose, expect that your fN builds won't be available immediately.

Thanks for understanding.

Regards,
Fedora Release Engineering
