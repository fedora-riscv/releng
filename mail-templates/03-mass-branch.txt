Hi All,

Fedora N has now been branched, please be sure to do a git pull
--rebase to pick up the new branch, as an additional reminder
rawhide/fN has been completely isolated from previous releases, so
this means that anything you do for fN you also have to do in the
rawhide branch and do a build there. There will be a Fedora N compose
and it'll appear in
http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/development/N/ once
complete. Please be sure to check it out. Bodhi is currently not
active for Fedora N, it will be enabled in a couple of weeks when we
hit Beta change freeze point in the Fedora N schedule[1].

Two things to remember:

1. The modules will be built for a new platform:fN+1
2. The signing of RPMs is not done yet with the new fN+1 key.
3. FN/branched release is frozen right now until we get a successful
compose, expect that your fN builds won't be available immediately.

Thanks for understanding.
