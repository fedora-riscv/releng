Hi all,

Today, MMM DD YYYY, is an important day on the Fedora N
schedule [1], with significant cut-offs.

Today we have the Final Freeze [2] which starts at 14:00 UTC. This
means that only packages which fix accepted blocker or freeze
exception bugs [3][4][5] will be marked as 'stable' and included in
the Final composes. Other builds will remain in updates-testing until
the Final release is approved, at which point the Final freeze is
lifted and packages can move to the 'updates' repository, pending
updates will be pushed before final release as zero day updates.
