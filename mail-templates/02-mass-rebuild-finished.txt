Hi all,

Per the Fedora Linux fN schedule [1] we started a mass rebuild for
Fedora Linux fN on YYYY-MM-DD. We did a mass rebuild for Fedora Linux fN
for:

<list changes that need mass rebuild here>
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/NAME

The mass rebuild was done in a side tag (fN-rebuild) and moved over to
fN. Failures can be seen
https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/fN-failures.html
Things still needing rebuilding
https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/fN-need-rebuild.html

X builds have been tagged into fN, there is currently Y failed builds
that need to be addressed by the package maintainers. FTBFS bugs will be
filed shortly. Please be sure to let releng know if you see any bugs in
the reporting. You can contact releng in #fedora-releng on libera.chat,
by dropping an email to our list [2], joining #releng:fedoraproject.org
on Matrix, or filing an issue in pagure [3]

Regards,
Fedora Release Engineering
