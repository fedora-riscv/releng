Hi all,

Per the Fedora f37 schedule[1] we have started a mass rebuild
on 2022-07-20 for Fedora f37. We are running this mass rebuild
for the changes listed in:

https://pagure.io/releng/issues?status=Open&tags=mass+rebuild

This mass rebuild will be done in a side tag (f37-rebuild) and merged
when completed.

Failures can be seen

<https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f37-failures.html>

Things still needing rebuilding
https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f37-need-rebuild.html
<https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f37-need-rebuild.html>

FTBFS (Fails To Build From Source) bugs will be filed shortly after
the mass rebuild is complete.

Please be sure to let releng know if you see any bugs in the
reporting. You can contact releng in #fedora-releng channel on Libera.Chat, 
the #releng:fedoraproject.org room on Matrix, or by dropping an email
to our list[2] or filing an issue in pagure[3].

This email template is also in https://pagure.io/releng if you wish to
propose improvements or changes to it.

Regards,

Fedora Release Engineering
