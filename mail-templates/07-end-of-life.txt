Hello all,

Fedora fN will go end of life for updates and support on YYYY-MM-DD
No more updates of any kind, including security updates or security
announcements, will be available for Fedora fN after the said date. All
the updates of Fedora fN being pushed to stable will be stopped as well.

Fedora fN+1 will continue to receive updates until approximately one
month after the release of Fedora fN+2. The maintenance schedule of
Fedora releases is documented on the Fedora Project wiki [0]. The
fedora Project wiki also contains instructions [1] on how to upgrade
from a previous release of Fedora to a version receiving updates.

Regards,
Fedora Release Engineering
