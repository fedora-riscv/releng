Hello all,

Fedora N will go end of life for updates and support on YYYY-MM-DD
No further updates, including security updates, will be
available for Fedora N after the said date. All the updates of Fedora
N being pushed to stable will be stopped as well.

Fedora N+1 will continue to receive updates until approximately one
month after the release of Fedora N+2. The maintenance schedule of
Fedora releases is documented on the Fedora Project wiki [0]. The
fedora Project wiki also contains instructions [1] on how to upgrade
from a previous release of Fedora to a version receiving updates.

Regards,
Fedora Release Engineering
